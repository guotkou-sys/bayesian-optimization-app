# Online Bayesian Optimization Website Blueprint

## 1. Project Goal and Current Status

The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly online platform that allows users to perform Bayesian optimization on their data. The website will guide users through the process of defining their optimization problem, running the optimization algorithm, and visualizing the results.

## 2. Key Features

*   **Data Upload:** Allow users to upload their data in common formats (e.g., CSV).
*   **Problem Definition (Manual Input):**
    *   Define the objective function to be minimized or maximized.
    *   Define the search space for the parameters (e.g., ranges, types).
    *   Allow dynamic addition and removal of multiple parameters with fields for name, type, and range/categories.
*   **Algorithm Selection:** Provide options for selecting different Bayesian optimization algorithms (e.g., different acquisition functions like Expected Improvement, Upper Confidence Bound).
*   **Optimization Execution:** Run the Bayesian optimization process based on the user's configuration.
*   **Visualization:**
    *   Plot the objective function value over iterations.
    *   Visualize the search space and the explored points.
    *   Display the best-found parameters and objective value.
*   **Experiment Management:**
    *   Save experiment configurations.
    *   Load previously saved configurations.
    *   View a history of past experiments.
*   **User Accounts (Optional):** Allow users to create accounts to manage their experiments across sessions.

## 3. Technology Stack

**Implemented So Far:**
*   **Frontend:** Basic Next.js project structure with App Router.
*   **Styling:** Basic CSS Modules (initial setup, minimal styling applied yet).
*   **Pages:** `/app/page.tsx` (initial structure for data upload, parameter/objective definition, and results display).
*   **Implemented Change:** Removed data upload functionality and added manual parameter input fields with descriptive text on `/app/page.tsx`.
*   **Implemented Component Type:** Parameter input section of `/app/page.tsx` is now a Client Component.
*   **Frontend:**
    *   Framework: Next.js (React)
    *   Styling: Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules
    *   Charting: Chart.js or Recharts
*   **Backend:**
    *   Framework: Node.js with Express.js or Next.js API Routes
    *   Bayesian Optimization Library: `scikit-optimize` (Python, requiring an execution environment) or a JavaScript equivalent if available and suitable for the scale.
    *   Data Handling: Libraries for parsing and processing uploaded data (e.g., `csv-parser`).
*   **Database (for saving/loading experiments):**
    *   Firebase Firestore (Serverless and easy to integrate)
    *   PostgreSQL or MongoDB (for more complex data structures or larger scale)

## 4. Data Flow

1.  User uploads data and defines the optimization problem on the frontend.
2.  User manually enters parameters and defines the optimization problem on the frontend. Frontend sends the configuration to the backend API.
3.  Backend processes the data, sets up the Bayesian optimization problem, and executes the algorithm.
4.  Backend sends the optimization progress and results back to the frontend.
5.  Frontend visualizes the results for the user.
6.  User can choose to save the experiment configuration.
7.  Saved configurations are stored in the database.
8.  User can load saved configurations from the database via the backend API.

## 5. Development Plan

1.  Set up the basic Next.js project structure.
2.  Develop the frontend components for manual parameter input and problem definition.
3.  Create backend API routes for receiving data and configuration.
4.  Integrate the chosen Bayesian optimization library into the backend.
5.  Implement the optimization execution logic on the backend.
6.  Develop frontend components for visualizing the optimization results.
7.  Implement the save and load functionality using the chosen database.
8.  Add user authentication if user accounts are included.
9.  Perform thorough testing and debugging.
10. Deploy the application.

## 6. Future Enhancements

*   Support for more data formats.
*   Possibility to re-introduce data upload as an alternative input method.
*   More advanced visualization options (e.g., interactive plots).
*   Options for parallel Bayesian optimization.
*   Integration with hyperparameter tuning libraries.
*   Community features (e.g., sharing experiments).
